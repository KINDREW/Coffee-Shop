# COFFEE SHOP APPLICATION
This project has two stacks
- BACKEND
- FRONTEND

## BACKEND
The backend was developed with Flask.
I created APIs to be accessed by the frontend.

## FRONTEND
The frontend was developed with Typescript and Angular Framework.

Each Stack has it own README file included so make reference to that for instructions on how to run the application.
